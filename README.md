## CS140E: embedded operating systems (Engler, Winter, 2025)

12/5/24: Enrollment for the class is open! [Please fill out the
application](https://forms.gle/1UuHUJsWSRGLSH8BA).  We will have rolling
acceptances throughout December.  Class is usually limited to around
50 students.

CS140E is an introductory operating systems course. It roughly covers
the same high-level material as [CS 212][cs212] (formerly CS 140), but
with a focus on embedded systems, interacting directly with hardware,
and verification. Both courses cover concepts such as virtual memory,
filesystems, networking, and scheduling, but take different approaches
to doing so. By the end of 140E, you will have (hopefully) built your
own simple, clean operating system for the widely-used, ARM-based
[Raspberry Pi][raspberrypi].
